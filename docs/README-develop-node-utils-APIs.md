## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

This document is a HowTo guide for writing new cisco_node_utils APIs. The APIs act as an interface between the NX-OS CLI and an agent's resource/provider. If written properly the new API will work as a common framework for multiple providers (Puppet, Chef, etc).  In addition to this guide, please reference the [cisco_node_utils development 'best practices' guide.](./README-develop-best-practices.md)

There are multiple components involved when creating new resources. This document focuses on the cisco_node_utils API, command reference YAML files, and minitests.

## <a name="prerequisites">Before You Begin</a>

### <a name="prereq_git">Git Configuration</a>

Any code commits must be associated with your github account and email address.  If you intend to commit code to this repository then you must configure `git` with your identity.  If you have not already done so, use the following commands to configure the default identity that `git` will use for all projects on your system:

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```
If you do not wish to change the global configuration on your system, you can set your identity for a single local repository by using the above commands without the ``--global`` flag.

### <a name="prereq_ruby">Ruby Prerequisites</a>

This project requires Ruby 2.0 or later.

This development guide uses tools that are packaged as gems that need to be installed in your development environment. You can install the gems manually but it's recommended to use [Bundler](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler) to guarantee the dependencies are all present.

```bash
gem install bundler
```
At present the following gems are needed to work on this code base - if you wish to install them all manually instead of through Bundler, you can run:

```bash
gem install grpc kwalify minitest net_http_unix rake rspec simplecov
gem install rubocop --version 0.35.1
```

**NOTE:** If you are working from a server where you don't have admin/root privileges, use the following commands to install the gems:

```bash
gem install --user-install bundler
gem install --user-install grpc kwalify minitest net_http_unix rake rspec simplecov
gem install --user-install rubocop --version 0.35.1
```
or add `--user-install` to your `.gemrc` to make this the default behavior:

```bash
echo 'gem: --user-install' >> ~/.gemrc
```
and then update the `PATH` to include `~/.gem/ruby/x.x.x/bin`.  For example, you could add this to your `.bashrc` or `.profile`:

```bash
if which ruby >/dev/null && which gem >/dev/null; then
    PATH="$(ruby -rubygems -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

### <a name="prereq_vm">Nexus VM (optional)</a>

A virtual Nexus N9000/N3000 may be helpful for development and testing. Users with a valid [cisco.com](http://cisco.com) user ID can obtain a copy of a virtual Nexus N9000/N3000 by sending their [cisco.com](http://cisco.com) user ID in an email to <get-n9kv@cisco.com>. If you do not have a [cisco.com](http://cisco.com) user ID please register for one at [https://tools.cisco.com/IDREG/guestRegistration](https://tools.cisco.com/IDREG/guestRegistration)


## <a name="clone">Start here: Fork and Clone the Repo</a>

First [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [cisco-network-node-utils](https://github.com/cisco/cisco-network-node-utils) repository on GitHub.

Next create your local repository. Clone the cisco-network-node-utils repo from your fork into a workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cisco-network-node-utils.git
cd cisco-network-node-utils/
```

If you're using Bundler, invoke it to ensure all of the development dependencies are installed on your system:

```bash
bundle install
```

or (if you don't have admin/root privileges and have used `--user-install` to install Bundler):

```bash
~/.gem/ruby/$RUBY_VERSION/bin/bundle install --path ~/.gem
```

If you intend to contribute your code back to the project then you should install the git hooks that are checked in with the project source code.  These hooks check your commits for conformance with various style guidelines.  To install them in your local repository (or to update them to match the files currently in the repository, in case they are out of sync), simply run the `update-hooks` script:

```bash
bin/git/update-hooks
```


## <a name="complex">Example: router eigrp</a>

As a best practice, create a topic branch (also sometimes called a feature branch) for your feature work using the `git branch feature/<feature_name>` command.

```bash
git branch feature/eigrp
git branch
* develop
  feature/eigrp
```

Before you start working on the eigrp feature, checkout its topic branch, `feature/eigrp`.

```bash
git checkout feature/eigrp
git branch
  develop
* feature/eigrp
```

`router eigrp` requires feature enablement and supports multiple eigrp instances. It also has multiple configuration levels for vrf and address-family.

For the purposes of this example we will only implement the following properties:

```bash
[no] feature eigrp               (boolean)
[no] router eigrp [name]         (string)
       maximum-paths [n]         (integer)
       [no] shutdown             (boolean)

Example:
  feature eigrp
  router eigrp Blue
    maximum-paths 5
    shutdown
```

### <a name="comp_yaml">Step 1. YAML Definitions: router eigrp</a>

The new API for `router eigrp` will need some basic YAML definitions. By convention we create a new YAML file to handle a new feature set, so we will create
the following file:

`lib/cisco_node_utils/cmd_ref/eigrp.yaml`

YAML files in the `/cmd_ref/` subdirectory are automatically discovered at runtime, so we don't need to do anything special once we have created this file

The following basic command_reference parameters will be defined for each resource property:

 1. `get_command:` This defines the CLI command (usually a 'show...' command) or similar request string used to retrieve the property's current configuration state. Note that some commands may not be present on NX-OS until a pre-requisite feature is enabled.
 2. `get_value:` A regexp pattern for extracting state values from the get_command output.
 3. `set_value:` The configuration command(s) used to set the property configuration. May contain wildcards for variable parameters.
 4. `default_value:` This is typically the "factory" default state of the property, expressed as an actual value (true, 12, "off", etc)
 5. `kind:` The data type of this property. If omitted, the property will be a string by default. Commonly used values for this property are `int` and `boolean`.
 6. `multiple:` By default a property is assumed to be found once or not at all by the `get_command`/`get_value` lookup, and an error will be raised if multiple matches are found. If multiple matches are valid and expected, you must set `multiple: true` for this property.

There are additional YAML command parameters available which are not covered by this document. Please see the [README_YAML.md](../lib/cisco_node_utils/cmd_ref/README_YAML.md) document for more information on the structure and semantics of these files.
The properties in this example require additional context for their `get_value` and `set_value` because they need to differentiate between different eigrp instances. This is done with the `context` parameter. (For more complex properties, you can define `get_context` and `set_context` separately if needed.) Most properties will also have a default value.

*Note: Eigrp also has vrf and address-family contexts. These contexts require additional coding and are beyond the scope of this document.*

#### Example: YAML Property Definitions for router eigrp

*Note: The basic token definitions for multi-level commands can become long and complicated. A better solution for these commands is to use a command_reference _template: definition to simplify the configuration. The example below will use the basic syntax; see the ospf definitions in the YAML file for an example of _template: usage.*

*Note: Property definitions in the YAML must be given in alphabetical order. Parameters under a property can be given in any order.*

```yaml
# eigrp.yaml
---
feature:
  # feature eigrp must be enabled before configuring router eigrp
  kind: boolean
  get_command: 'show running eigrp all'
  get_value: 'feature eigrp'
  set_value: '<state> feature eigrp'

maximum_paths:
  # This is an integer property
  kind: int
  context: 
    - 'router eigrp <name>'
  get_command: 'show running eigrp all'
  get_value: 'maximum-paths (\d+)'
  set_value: 'maximum-paths <val>'
  default_value: 8

router:
  # There can be multiple eigrp instances
  multiple: true
  get_command: 'show running eigrp all'         # all eigrp-related configs
  get_value: 'router eigrp (\S+)'   # Match instance name
  set_value: '<state> router eigrp <name>'    # config to add or remove

shutdown:
  # This is a boolean property
  kind: boolean
  context:
    - 'router eigrp <name>'
  get_command: 'show running eigrp all'
  get_value: 'shutdown'
  set_value: '<state> shutdown'
  default_value: false
```

### <a name="comp_api">Step 2. cisco_node_utils API: router eigrp</a>

* The `template-router.rb` file provides a basic router API that we will use as the basis for `router_eigrp.rb`:

```bash
cp  docs/template-router.rb  lib/cisco_node_utils/router_eigrp.rb
```

* Our new `router_eigrp.rb` requires changes from the original template. Edit `router_eigrp.rb` and change the placeholder names as shown.

```
/X__CLASS_NAME__X/RouterEigrp/

/X__RESOURCE_NAME__X/eigrp/

/X__PROPERTY_BOOL__X/shutdown/

/X__PROPERTY_INT__X/maximum_paths/
```

*Note that this template only provides example property methods for a few properties. Copy the example methods for additional properties as needed.*

#### Example: router_eigrp.rb
This is the completed `router_eigrp` API based on `template-router.rb`:

    end

    def feature_disable

    def maximum_paths=(val)
      config_set('eigrp', 'maximum_paths', name: @name, val: val)
    end
  end
end
```

### <a name="comp_minitest">Step 3. Minitest: router eigrp</a>

* Use `template-test_router.rb` to build the minitest for `router_eigrp.rb`:

```
cp  docs/template-test_router.rb  tests/test_router_eigrp.rb
```
* As with the API code, edit `test_router_eigrp.rb` and change the placeholder names as shown:

```
/X__CLASS_NAME__X/RouterEigrp/

/X__RESOURCE_NAME__X/eigrp/

/X__PROPERTY_BOOL__X/shutdown/

/X__PROPERTY_INT__X/maximum_paths/
```

* At a minimum, the tests should include coverage for:
  * creating & destroying a single `router eigrp` instance
  * creating & destroying multiple `router eigrp` instances
  * feature disablement when removing last `router eigrp`
  * testing each property state

#### Example: test_router_eigrp.rb
This is the completed `test_router_eigrp` minitest based on `template-test_router.rb`:

    id = 'blue'
    rtr = RouterEigrp.new(id)
    @default_show_command = "show runn | i 'router eigrp #{id}'")
    assert_show_match(pattern: /^router eigrp #{id}$/,
                      msg:     "failed to create router eigrp #{id}")

    rtr.destroy

  end

  def test_router_create_destroy_multiple
    id1 = 'blue'
    rtr1 = RouterEigrp.new(id1)
    id2 = 'red'
    rtr2 = RouterEigrp.new(id2)

    @default_show_command = "show runn | i 'router eigrp'"

    assert_show_match(pattern: /^router eigrp #{id1}$/,
                      msg:     "failed to create router eigrp #{id1}")

    assert_show_match(pattern: /^router eigrp #{id2}$/,
                      msg:     "failed to create router eigrp #{id2}")

    rtr1.destroy
    refute_show_match(pattern: /^router eigrp #{id1}$/,
                      msg:     "failed to destroy router eigrp #{id1}")

    rtr2.destroy
    refute_show_match(pattern: /^router eigrp #{id2}$/,
                      msg:     "failed to destroy router eigrp #{id2}")

    refute_show_match(command: "show runn | i 'feature eigrp'",
                      pattern: /^feature eigrp$/,
                      msg:     "failed to disable feature eigrp")
  end

  def test_router_maximum_paths
    id = 'blue'
    rtr = RouterEigrp.new(id)
    val = 5 # This value depends on property bounds
    rtr.maximum_paths = val
    assert_equal(rtr.maximum_paths, val, "maximum_paths is not #{val}")

    # Get default value from yaml
    val = node.config_get_default('eigrp', 'maximum_paths')
    rtr.maximum_paths = val

  def test_router_shutdown
    id = 'blue'

    assert(rtr.shutdown, 'shutdown state is not true')

    rtr.shutdown = false
    refute(rtr.shutdown, 'shutdown state is not false')
  end
end
```

Now run the test:

```bash

Run options: -v -- --seed 56593

# Running:

5 tests, 12 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

### <a name="comp_lint">Step 4. rubocop: router eigrp</a>

rubocop is a Ruby static analysis tool. Run rubocop to validate the new code:

```bash
% rubocop lib/cisco_node_utils/router_eigrp.rb tests/test_router_eigrp.rb
Inspecting 2 file
..

2 file inspected, no offenses detected
```

### <a name="comp_gem">Step 5. Build and Install the gem</a>

The final step is to build and install the gem that contains the new APIs.

Please note: `gem build` will only include files that are part of the repository. This means that new files `router_eigrp.rb` and `eigrp.yaml` will be ignored by the build until they are added to the repo with `git add`:

```bash
git add lib/cisco_node_utils/router_eigrp.rb \
        lib/cisco_node_utils/cmd_ref/eigrp.yaml
```

From the root of the cisco-network-node-utils repository issue the following command.

```bash
% gem build cisco_node_utils.gemspec
  Successfully built RubyGem
  Name: cisco_node_utils
  Version: 1.0.1
  File: cisco_node_utils-1.0.1.gem
```

Copy the new gem to your NX-OS device and then install it.

```bash
n9k#gem install --local /bootflash/cisco_node_utils-1.0.1.gem
Successfully installed cisco_node_utils-1.0.1
Parsing documentation for cisco_node_utils-1.0.1
Installing ri documentation for cisco_node_utils-1.0.1
Done installing documentation for cisco_node_utils after 2 seconds
1 gem installed
```

## Conclusion

This was hopefully a good introduction to writing a Cisco node_utils API. At this point you could continue adding properties or try your hand at writing Puppet or Chef provider code to utilize your new API.
