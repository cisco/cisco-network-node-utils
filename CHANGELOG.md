### Added

* Enabled [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) integration to automatically run [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop). Fixed all baseline rubocop warnings.
* Added git hooks to streamline certain processes:
  * Validate commit message format for consistency
  * Don't allow commit of code failing RuboCop `--lint` checks
  * If RuboCop is failing any check, warn on commit (but don't fail), and fail on push.
  * Don't allow push without updating CHANGELOG.md
  * Once git hooks are installed, automatically update them on pull/merge (if possible).
  * If using [git-flow]:
    * `git flow release start` and `git flow hotfix start` will automatically update `CHANGELOG.md` and `version.rb` for the new release version
    * `git flow release finish` will automatically bump the version number for the develop branch.
* Minitest enhancements:
  * Code coverage calculation using [SimpleCov]
  * Full Minitest suite can be run by `rake test`
  * UUT can be specified by the `NODE` environment variable or at runtime, in addition to the classic method of command line arguments to `ruby test_my_file.rb`
  * Added `config` and `(assert|refute)_show_match` helper methods for testing.
* Added `bin/check_metric_limits.rb` helper script in support of refactoring.
* Added best practices development guide.
* Added support for radius_global (@jonnytpuppet)
* Added support for radius_server_group (@jonnytpuppet)

### Fixed

* Fixed several bugs in `SnmpUser.(auth|priv)_password_equal?`
* Fixed a bug in `test_interface.rb` that was keeping it from properly exercising the `negotiate_auto` functionality.
* Added a cache_flush call in `Platform.chassis` to work around an infrequent issue.

### Changed

* Added missing steps to CONTRIBUTING.md and README-develop-node-utils-APIs.md
* Added git config comments
* Moved `platform_info.(rb|yaml)` from `lib/` to `tests/` as it is test-only code.
* Now requires Minitest ~> 5.0 instead of Minitest < 5.0.

### Removed

* Dropped support for Ruby 1.9.3 as it is end-of-life.
* Removed `test_all_cisco.rb` as `rake test` can auto-discover all tests.

* Added dotted-decimal munging for the area getter in interface_ospf.
